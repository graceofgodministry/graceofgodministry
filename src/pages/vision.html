                <h2>Help People in Need</h2>
                <p>One of our visions for Grace of God Ministry, is helping those in need, providing those who need food and clothing. We have already started this vision of ours, by gifting food, clothing and Bibles. Learning from the Bible and learning about the word of God is important as God has told us to help those in need and teach them about God and his works. We wish to continue with the vision and proceed with helping those in need. </p>

                <h2>Build a Church</h2>
                <p>Our second vision for Grace of God Ministry is to build few churches in different locations around the world, where there are no churches. We plan to proceed with this vision,so that the people can visit and listen to the word of God. We hope to preach the word of God to as many people as we can, so that their lives too can be transformed, just like how God changed ours, after we started attending Church. Church is a place of worship, where all those who are a part of Grace of God Ministry, can come together as a community to praise and glorify God’s name. Together we can become a stronger community of Grace of God Ministry.</p>

                <p>Our third vision for Grace of God Ministry is to deliver the Gospel of God to everyone who is in the darkness, and show them the light through Jesus Christ.</p> 
                <p  class="font-italic small-font">"This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all. 6 If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth. 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin." <span class="badge badge-light" style="font-size: 11px;">John 1:5-7</span></p>
                <p  class="font-italic small-font">"Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”" <span class="badge badge-light" style="font-size: 11px;">John 8:12</span></p>
                <p  class="font-italic small-font">"“You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven." <span class="badge badge-light" style="font-size: 11px;">Matthew 5:14-16</span></p>

                  <h2>Prepare pastors and servants of the lord</h2>
                  <p>Our fourth vision for Grace of God Ministry, is to prepare the youngsters and overall the people in our Ministry, for them to be servants of the Lord. Those who obey God’s Commandments written in the Bible and practice them, are servants of the Lord. Our aim is to prepare all those who are a part of our ministry to learn and become servants of the Lord. We, people of God serve a righteous master,and to be the servants of God, we must learn to be a praying person, humble and be a faithful servant to God. God has given each and everyone of his people spiritual gifts. We need to receive those gifts, and use them as God has directed us to, and save those from sins. </p>
                  <p  class="font-italic small-font">"8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
                    9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
                    10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:"
